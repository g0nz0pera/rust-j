In this exercise, you'll finish implementing a function that receives a Person struct and returns a String that contains the full name of the person.

Keep in mind that some people don't have a middle name but if they do, it must be included in the return value.

You must edit only the build_full_name function. The part that handles the first and last names has already been implemented for you.
